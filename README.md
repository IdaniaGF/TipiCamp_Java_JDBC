***TipiCamp*** is as par of **Alura Challenges + Oracle**.
***TipiCamp*** is a fictitious desktop Java application for managing reservations and guests at a campsite.

✅ The application was build based on the following requirements: 
* User authentication system so that only users belonging to the hotel can access the system;
* Allow creating, editing and deleting a reservation for clients;
* Search in the database all the information of both clients and reservations;
* Register, edit and delete guest data;
* Calculate the value of the reservation based on the number of days of the reservation and a daily rate and in the local currency of your country, all this must be done automatically and shown to the user before saving the reservation;
* Database to store all previously requested data.

💻 To do this I created a local Mysql database with a relationship between entities of 1-n. The connection to the database was made with the JDBC API. The Model View Controller design pattern was used. 

⚙ I worked with the **Trello** tool to manage the activities of each stage of the project.

🎨 The graphical interface made in swing was provided to us, however I manipulated it to my liking, added buttons and changed the logo.

📅 The project was developed in its entirety in a time of one week.
